//what the hell is CSFR protection?
// CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection is a security measure used to prevent unauthorized actions on behalf of a user. It ensures that requests made to a web application are intentional and originate from the authenticated user. This is typically done by including a unique token in forms and validating it on the server side when the form is submitted. If the token is missing or invalid, the request is rejected, preventing potential attacks.
// CSRF protection is important because it helps safeguard against malicious actions that could be performed without the user's consent, such as changing account settings, making purchases, or submitting forms.
